# Temenos T24 Automation Framework
Automation framework built for Temenos T24 core banking application using **Selenium**, **Java**, **Cucumber (BDD)**, and **Excel-driven test data**.

---

##  Overview
This project highlights my real-world experience in building scalable, maintainable automation solutions within enterprise banking environments.  
It focuses on automating **customer update workflows** in Temenos T24, including scenarios where data is **added, updated, or intentionally left blank**, based on Excel-driven input.

The framework demonstrates my ability to design structured, modular, and professional-grade automation systems suitable for complex financial applications.

 **Note:** Temenos T24 is a licensed banking platform.  
This repository showcases my automation expertise, but the framework cannot be executed without an enterprise instance.

##  Technology Stack
- **Java**
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **Cucumber (BDD) & Gherkin**
- **Maven**
- **Excel/Apache POI (Data-Driven Testing)**

---

##  Key Highlights
- Built a **fully data-driven automation framework** for Temenos T24
- Implemented **end-to-end customer update workflows**, including multiple entries and empty-field validation
- Designed clear, readable **BDD test scenarios** using Gherkin
- Developed **modular, reusable automation components**
- Ensured strong separation of test logic, business steps, and UI abstraction layers
- Demonstrated hands-on automation engineering capability in enterprise banking systems

##  Automation Recording
A screen recording of the automated Temenos T24 workflow is included to visually demonstrate:

- Customer update automation in action
- Multiple entries added and updated from Excel
- Execution of BDD scenarios via Cucumber
- Selenium-driven UI steps inside the T24 environment

This recording provides recruiters and engineers with a clear view of how the framework performs live automation on an enterprise banking system.
